What is Routes and Route in React?
React Router is a library used for handling navigation in React applications. It enables single-page applications (SPAs) to have different views without requiring a full-page reload.

Routes: It is a wrapper that contains multiple Route components. It tells React Router that we are defining multiple routes inside it.
Route: It defines a specific path (path='') and what component (element={<Component />}) should be rendered when the user visits that path.

=======================================================================

✔ BrowserRouter is required to enable routing in React.
✔ It tracks the URL and renders the correct component.
✔ Always wrap your <App /> component with <BrowserRouter> in index.js.
✔ Use <Routes> and <Route> inside BrowserRouter to define different paths.

Why is BrowserRouter Necessary?
Enables Single-Page Application (SPA) Routing

React doesn’t reload the page when switching routes. It updates only the necessary part of the UI.
Keeps URL in Sync with UI

React Router updates the browser’s address bar (/home, /about, etc.) while displaying the correct component.
Handles History and Navigation

It allows users to go back and forward using the browser’s navigation buttons.

======================================================================

in axios.js

we create a custom axios called "axiosInstance" the benefit is that now we export this function 
and when we use 

axiosInstance.get("short-url");

instead of the long URL "http://localhost:5001/api/auth/check"

2 ways to set states :
    set((state)=>({...state, authUser:res.data}))
    set({authUser:null})
